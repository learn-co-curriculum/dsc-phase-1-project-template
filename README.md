# Microsoft enters Film Industry: Data Analysis and Recommendations

Team: Diego Fernandez, Rachael McCue, Parker DeShazo


## Overview
Microsoft will be entering the film industry, and we were tasked with analzying some data sets to set them up for success on their first film. Using domain knowledge, and the datasets provided below, we drew insights about the movie industry, genres, creative talent, and release dates that have shown to be successful. 

Data is reviewed from:
  IMDB
  The Numbers
  The Movie Database
  

## Business Understanding
Microsoft, while a head honcho is many other facets, is the underdog in the film industry. They have the capital to produce a film, but perhaps not the experience. In order for Microsoft to insert themselves into the $209B industry, we studied what would be a successful safe-bet first movie. What genres are proven to be successful? What time of year should you release a film? Who should you hire to produce the film? 

We used total revenue to locate successful genres to tap into, as well as return on investmemt to see who to hire and when to release a film. 


## Data Understanding and Analysis

Our insights were retrieved by creating a master data set with the following parameters: a budget of at least $10 million to rule out the small or independent filmmakers, dropped any data that did not have a worldwide gross income datapoint, _____________. 

The master dataset inclues the following information:
  Release Date
  Movie Name 
  Production Budget
  Inflation Adjusted Production Budget 
  Domestic Gross 
  Worldwide Gross
  Worldwide Profit
  ROI
  Person Name
  Movie Role 
  And boolean values for all of the genres:
  Action, Adult, Adventure, Animation, Biography, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Family, Fantasy, Game-Show, History, Horror Music, Musical, Mystery,   News, Reality-TV, RomanceSci-Fi, Short, Sport, Talk-Show, Thriller, War, Western
 
 This left us with 1091 movies from 2010-2020.
 
 While merging some individual datasets, we merged on Movie Name amd Release Date as keys so we knew we were referencing the correct movie. There were some duplicate movie names, such as Avatar. Did you know there is a Japanese horror film called Avatar?
